                    <h4>My First Job as a Junior Web Developer</h4>
                    <hr>
                    <p>My first job as a junior web developer was at a hackathon. 
                        I was tasked with creating a simple web application using Python and Flask. 
                        I was able to complete the project in a few hours and present it to the judges. 
                        I received positive feedback from the judges and my team members, which gave me the confidence to continue pursuing a career in web development.
                    </p>
        
                    <p>So now I feel really confident in my skills and I am ready to take on more complex projects.
                        My next goal is to learn more about machine learning and cybersecurity.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p>My experience as a developer has been very rewarding. I have been able to work on a variety of projects and learn new technologies along the way. 
                        I have also had the opportunity to collaborate with other developers and learn from their experiences. 
                        I have found that the key to success as a developer is to be open to new ideas and willing to learn from others.

                    <p>PS: I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow as a developer.</p>
